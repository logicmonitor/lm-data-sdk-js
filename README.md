# LogicMonitor JS Data SDK

LogicMonitor JS Data SDK is suitable for ingesting the metrics and logs into the LogicMonitor Platform.

## Overview
LogicMonitor's Push Metrics feature allows you to send metrics directly to the LogicMonitor platform via a dedicated API, removing the need to route the data through a LogicMonitor Collector. Once ingested, these metrics are presented alongside all other metrics gathered via LogicMonitor, providing a single pane of glass for metric monitoring and alerting.

Similarly, If a log integration isnâ€™t available or you have custom logs that you want to analyze, you can send the logs directly to your LogicMonitor account via the logs ingestion API.

## Quick Start Notes:

### Set Configurations
While using LMv1 authentication set LM_ACCESS_ID and LM_ACCESS_KEY properties.
In case of BearerToken authentication set LM_BEARER_TOKEN property. 
Company's name or Account name must be passed to LM_ACCOUNT property. 
All properties can be set using environment variable.
